## Overview
Analyzing churn refers to the process of examining why customers stop using a product or service and identifying ways to reduce this behavior. It involves more than just calculating the churn rateâ€”it requires a deep dive into customer behavior, identifying trends, and uncovering the root causes of customer attrition.

### Objectives
Churn analysis helps you identify pain points throughout the entire customer journey. Understanding those pain points then opens up avenues to improve your products, services, and communication. Here are the objectives of doing churn analysis:

#### 1. Understand Churn Rate
* Calculate the overall churn rate to establish a baseline.
* Compare churn rates across different customer segments.

#### 2. Analyze Key Factors
* Investigate relationships between churn and variables such as demographics, tenure, usage patterns, and billing preferences
* Identify trends and high-risk groups

#### 3. Segment Customers
* Use segmentation to understand which types of customers are more likely to churn (e.g., by age, contract type, or region).

#### 4. Provide Insights for Retention Strategies
* Highlight areas where improvements can reduce churn, such as customer service, pricing, or product features.

#### 5. Create a Dashboard
* Build a visually appealing dashboard to summarize key metrics, trends, and insights.
* Ensure interactivity with filters or slicers for dynamic exploration of the data.

### About the data

The data consists of four parts:
* Customer status: the status and reason why customers churned
* Demographics: demographic data on each customer
* Contract information: information on the type of contract
* Subscription types & charges: numerical data on how the customer uses his subscription

### Methodology

#### 1. Data Preparation
* The data used is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yichienchong/databel-telecom-customer-churn-dataset/data)
* Perform data cleaning and preparation for filtering out irrelevant or inaccurate data and handling missing or duplicate values

#### 2. Data Exploration
* Conduct Descriptive Statistical Analysis
* Visualize Numeric Data Distributions

#### 3. Feature Engineering
* Create calculated columns to see tenure grouping and revenue impact
* Customer segmentation

#### 4. Churn Analysis Using PivotTables
* Create insightful PivotTables
* Analyze trends
* Calculate Churn Rate

#### 5. Create Dashboard
* Churn rate visualization
* Churn breakdown
* Key drivers of churn
* Financial impact
* Interactive Features

#### 6. Tools and Techniques:
* Calculated Columns: Create new fields for churn indicators, tenure groups, or average revenue
* PivotTables: Summarize and visualize relationships between churn and other variables
* Charts: Use bar charts, line charts, or heatmaps to present trends and patterns clearly
* Dashboard Design: Combine key metrics and visualizations into an easy-to-understand format for stakeholders

#### 8. Summary
<div align="justify">
A total of 26.86% of customers have churned, resulting in a significant $1,367,515 loss in revenue. The analysis reveals that the primary driver of customer churn is competition, with rival companies offering superior services. Notably, customers with an account tenure of 1-10 months are the most likely to leave, representing the highest concentration of churn. Additionally, nearly 90% of churned customers share two key characteristics: they are subscribed to the international plan and have a month-to-month contract, highlighting potential areas for targeted retention strategies.
