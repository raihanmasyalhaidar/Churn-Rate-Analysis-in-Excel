## Overview
Analyzing churn refers to the process of examining why customers stop using a product or service and identifying ways to reduce this behavior. It involves more than just calculating the churn rate—it requires a deep dive into customer behavior, identifying trends, and uncovering the root causes of customer attrition.
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn rates using a structured dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and reasons behind customer attrition. The goal is to enable data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention strategies. The analysis is presented through a comprehensive and interactive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel, offering insights into key metrics and visualizations for effective decision-making.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:

### 1. Understand Customer Behavior:
Analyze customer demographics, service usage, and financial metrics to identify factors contributing to churn.

### 2. Identify Churn Drivers:
Pinpoint the key attributes and patterns (e.g., age group, payment method, contract type) that influence customer churn.

### 3. Segment Customers:
Group customers based on demographic and behavioral characteristics to identify high-risk segments and tailored retention strategies.

### 4. Visualize Insights:
Create clear and interactive visualizations to present data-driven insights that are easy for stakeholders to understand.

### 5. Monitor Churn Metrics:
Track and measure key churn metrics, including overall churn rate, churn by category, and churn by reason.

### 6. Enable Stakeholder Engagement:
Build a user-friendly Excel dashboard to empower stakeholders to explore the data dynamically and make informed decisions.

### 7. Develop Retention Strategies:
Use insights from the analysis to recommend targeted actions for reducing churn, such as service improvements, pricing optimizations, or enhanced customer engagement programs.

## Dataset

The data used is sourced from: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yichienchong/databel-telecom-customer-churn-dataset/data)

## Methodology

#### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
* Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
* Normalize and group categorical data for easier visualization.
* Identify and treat outliers to ensure data accuracy.

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Perform descriptive and inferential analysis to understand the relationships between variables.
* Identify the main drivers of churn, such as demographic factors, contract types, or service preferences.
* Use statistical methods to validate findings.

#### 3. Visualization and Insights using Pivot:
* Create charts and graphs to highlight key metrics, such as: Churn rates by age group, contract type, and payment method, impact of additional services (e.g., Device Protection) on churn, and monthly charges versus total charges for churned vs. retained customers
* Present findings in a clear and concise manner for stakeholders.

#### 4. Dashboard Creation:
* Design an interactive and user-friendly Excel dashboard with the following features: Dynamic Filters: Enable users to filter data by attributes such as age group, contract type, and payment method, visual Representations: Include bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and heatmaps for data trends, key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Display metrics such as overall churn rate, churn by customer segment, and high-risk groups.

5. Actionable Recommendations:
* Provide insights into areas for improvement, such as: Optimizing pricing strategies for high-risk segments, enhancing services to reduce voluntary churn, targeted engagement for senior or under-30 customers.

#### 6. Tools and Techniques:
* PivotTables: Summarize and visualize relationships between churn and other variables
* Charts: Use bar charts, line charts, or heatmaps to present trends and patterns clearly
* Dashboard Design: Combine key metrics and visualizations into an easy-to-understand format for stakeholders

#### 8. Summary
<div align="justify">
A total of 26.86% of customers have churned, resulting in a significant $1,367,515 loss in revenue. The analysis reveals that the primary driver of customer churn is competition, with rival companies offering superior services. Notably, customers with an account tenure of 1-10 months are the most likely to leave, representing the highest concentration of churn. Additionally, nearly 90% of churned customers share two key characteristics: they are subscribed to the international plan and have a month-to-month contract, highlighting potential areas for targeted retention strategies.

#### 9. Strategic Recomendation
To reduce customer churn, several strategic recommendations can be implemented. First, addressing competition-driven churn is critical; conducting competitive analyses, offering exclusive promotions, and enhancing brand differentiation can help retain customers. Improving the early customer experience is also essential, as most churn occurs within the first 1–10 months. Implementing robust onboarding programs, monitoring satisfaction levels, and offering proactive customer support during this period can significantly reduce early churn. Pricing concerns should also be addressed by reassessing the pricing structure, introducing flexible tiered plans, and highlighting service value to justify costs. Additionally, promoting unlimited data plans, especially to high-data users, can cater to their needs and reduce the likelihood of churn. Geographically, targeting states with high churn through localized campaigns and addressing region-specific issues like network quality or competition can be impactful. For customers on month-to-month contracts, offering incentives to switch to longer-term plans or bundling services could improve retention. Finally, investing in predictive analytics to identify at-risk customers and deploying personalized engagement strategies, such as discounts or tailored offers, can help retain dissatisfied customers and strengthen long-term customer loyalty.
